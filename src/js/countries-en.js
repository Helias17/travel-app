    Jamaica is the third largest of the Caribbean islands, and the largest English-speaking island in the Caribbean Sea.

    In pre-columbian times Jamaica was inhabited by an estimated 60,000 Arawak Indians. In 1494 Christopher Columbus "discovered" the island and claimed it at once for the King and Queen of Spain. In 1517 first Africans brought to Jamaica by the Spaniards. The British arrived in 1655, defeated the Spaniards and claimed the island for the King of England.
    
    By the late 17th and early 18th centuries the island was virtually divided. Colonial planters and their slaves inhabited and worked in the costal plains, while high up in the Blue Mountains there lived fugitive slaves, the free community of the Maroons.
    
    More than 300 years later on August 6, 1962, Jamaica became an independent sovereign state and a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

    The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990.

    Cape Verde continues to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result, Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one. Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese ancestors.

    he Republic of Vanuatu is an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Caledonia, east of Australia and west of Fiji.

    The Y-shaped chain of fourteen main islands between the South Pacific Ocean and the Coral Sea is of volcanic origin and home to several active volcanoes. The colliding Pacific and Indo-Australian continental plates provide for geological activities like earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, and volcanic eruptions, hardly tourist attractions. But Mount Yasur on Tanna Island is an easily accessible active volcano, and a major Vanuatu tourist attraction, especially at night.
    
    Highest point is Mount Tabwemasana, at 1,879 m (6,165 ft), located on the island of Espiritu Santo.
    
    The combined land area of the islands is 12,189 km², this is about the size of the Falkland Islands, or slightly larger than Connecticut.
    
    The archipelago has a population of 278,000 (in 2015), capital and largest city is Port Vila.
    Spoken languages are Bislama (English-based creole), English, French and various Austronesian languages.

    The Bahamas stretches for 760 miles from the coast of Florida in the northwest to almost Haiti in the southeast. The archipelago consists of about 2,400 Cays (coral reefs) and 700 islands, 30 of which are inhabited.

    When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492 on the island of San Salvador, the Caribbean islands were inhabited by Lucayans, a subgroup of Arawak Indians. Slavery, disease, and other hardships wiped out the entire tribe within 25 years of Columbus' arrival.
    
    A British settlement in The Bahamas was established in 1647 by a group of English Puritans, known as the Company of Eleutheran Adventurers.
    They took over an island the Arawaks called Cigatoo and named it Eleuthera, the Greek word for freedom.
    In 1717 and again in 1783, the islands became a British colony.
    
    The real Pirates of the Caribbean. During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, piracy flourished in the islands because of their proximity to important shipping lanes. The pirates, based at Nassau, attacked French and Spanish ships, while the French and Spanish forces burned Nassau several more times.
    
    Today The Bahamas has become one of the world's foremost vacation resorts. Nassau is the political capital and the commercial hub of The Bahamas.
